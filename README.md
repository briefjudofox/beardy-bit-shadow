# Beardy Bit Shadow

After seeing [@vinceallenvince](https://twitter.com/vinceallenvince)'s [presentation](http://foldi.github.io/jsfest2014/slides.pdf) at [@JavaScriptFest](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptFest) I was inspired to test out 2 of his projects: [Bit-Shadow-Machine](https://github.com/foldi/Bit-Shadow-Machine) and [Bit-Shadow-Press](https://github.com/foldi/Bit-Shadow-Press).  

I wanted to show my beard disappearing from one side to the other.  It's no [running cats](http://www.bitshadowmachine.com/projects/cats/), but it's an okay start:
